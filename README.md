## My Projects

Here are a few of the Python projects that I'm most proud of, however some might have been discontinued:

- [Project 2](https://github.com/frux-c/VendorBot): A discord bot fully written in python running on AWS, to vend files upon request, some use cases may include Q&A papers, templates, etc...
